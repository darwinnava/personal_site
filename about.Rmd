I am a leader, with initiative, passionate about my self-development, and with a great goal motivation! 

Engineering, as well as being curious, critical, argumentative and teamworking have been key tools, which have made possible to provide tangible solutions in organizations, even those with a dynamic and changing environment.

I would like to be part of a multidisciplinary team, in an organization that allows professional growth, challenging projects and an excellent work environment.
